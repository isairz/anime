# anime-bot

It's a bot to send alarm via [LINE Notify](https://notify-bot.line.me).

The code here did its job with no problem, but [@noraesae](https://github.com/noraesae)
was just boring enough to completely rewrite this bot in Haskell. You can look
into the Haskell version [here](https://github.com/team-kke/anime-bot).

For the time being, the Haskell version is running on *the free server* :pizza:
